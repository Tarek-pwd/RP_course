    "## Checking for Missing Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "To check for missing dependencies in a ROS package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ rosdep check <package name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: For this command to work, the workspace must first be sourced:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ source devel/setup.bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command provides a list of the system dependencies that are missing and where to get them.\n",

    "## Installing Dependencies with rosdep\n",
    "\n",
    "To have `rosdep` install packages, invoke the following command from the root of the catkin workspace:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ rosdep install -i <package name>\n",

    "## simple_arm Package Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the build and run dependencies for the `simple_arm` package have already been installed in the workspace. You can double-check using `rosdep check`:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd ~/catkin_ws\n",
    "$ source devel/setup.bash\n",
    "$ rosdep check simple_arm\n",
