    "## Step 1: Create a Catkin Workspace and a Subdirectory\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the ROS-related code you develop throughout this course will reside in your catkin workspace. You only need to create and initialize the workspace once.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create the top-level catkin workspace directory and a sub-directory named `src` (pronounced source). The top-level directory name is arbitrary, but is often called `catkin_ws` (an abbreviation of catkin_workspace), so we will follow this convention. You can create these two directories in `/home` with a single command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Navigate to the Source Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, navigate to the `src` directory with the `cd` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Initialize the Catkin Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can initialize the catkin workspace which will create a `CMakeLists.txt` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ catkin_init_workspace\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](lesson2p2_img1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s list the contents of the current directory to see what changed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ls -l\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that a symbolic link (`CMakeLists.txt`) has been created to `/opt/ros/kinetic/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Return to Top Level Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Return to the `catkin_ws` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd ~/catkin_ws\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Build the Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "Build the workspace:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ catkin_make\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You must issue this command from within the top-level directory (i.e., within `catkin_ws`, NOT `catkin_ws/src`).\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is not essential that you have a deep understanding of the catkin build system, particularly if you are doing most of your development work in Python, it is helpful to learn about it. We encourage you to read the [ROS wiki](https://wiki.ros.org/catkin).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the command is executed, you will notice the output of the build processes being echoed to your display. When it has finished, you should see the following lines at the end of the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "-- BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is on\n",
    "-- Configuring done\n",
    "-- Generating done\n",
    "-- Build files have been written to: ~/catkin_ws/build\n",
    "####\n",
    "#### Running command: \"make -j4 -l4\" in \"~/catkin_ws/build\"\n",
    "####\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What else has changed? Use the `ls` command again to see what is new:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](lesson2p2_img2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have two new directories: `build` and `devel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The aptly named `build` directory is the build space for C++ packages. For the most part, you will not interact with it.\n",
    "- The `devel` directory contains a file of interest: `setup.bash`. This `setup.bash` script must be sourced before using the catkin workspace:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ source devel/setup.bash\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6: Commentary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You just created your first catkin workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin to work with and develop your own ROS package, you can take a moment to get acquainted with catkin workspace conventional directory structure as described in the [ROS Enhancement Proposal (REP) 128](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0128.html).\n",
