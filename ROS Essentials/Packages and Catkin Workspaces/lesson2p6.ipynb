    "# Creating Your First ROS Package\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll begin your dive into ROS packages by creating one of your own. All ROS packages should reside under the `src` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Navigate to the src Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have already sourced your ROS environment and your catkin workspace, navigate to the `src` directory:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Create a Catkin Package\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for creating a catkin package is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ catkin_create_pkg <your_package_name> [dependency1 dependency2 …]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of your package is arbitrary, but you may encounter issues if you have multiple packages with the same name in your catkin workspace. Make it descriptive and unique without being excessively long. By convention, package names are lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s name our package `first_package` without specifying any dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ catkin_create_pkg first_package\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Congratulations!\n",
    "\n",
    "You just created your first catkin package! Navigating inside the newly created package reveals that it contains two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CMakeLists.txt**\n",
    "2. **package.xml**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a minimum working catkin package. It doesn’t do much yet, but it meets all the requirements for a catkin package. These two files describe dependencies and how catkin should interact with them.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Typical ROS Package Directory Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A more typical ROS package includes the following directories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **scripts**: Python executables\n",
    "- **src**: C++ source files\n",
    "- **msg**: Custom message definitions\n",
    "- **srv**: Service message definitions\n",
    "- **include**: Headers/libraries needed as dependencies\n",
    "- **config**: Configuration files\n",
    "- **launch**: Files to automate the starting of nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Folders\n",
    "\n",
    "- **urdf**: Universal Robot Description Files\n",
    "- **meshes**: CAD files in `.dae` (Collada) or `.stl` (STereoLithography) format\n",
    "- **worlds**: XML-like files used for Gazebo simulation environments\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explore More ROS Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install many ROS packages. To see a list of available packages for the Noetic distribution, visit the following link:\n",
