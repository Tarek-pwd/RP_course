    "One of the biggest benefits of using ROS is its large community of users and developers who have already created a lot of reusable code.\n",

    "## Cloning the Package\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by navigating to the `src` directory and cloning the `simple_arm` package for this lesson from its GitHub repo:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/\n",
    "$ git clone -b first_interaction https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-simple_arm/ simple_arm\n",

    "\n",
    "After the repo has finished cloning, navigate to the top-level of the ROS workspace and build the new package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd ~/catkin_ws\n",

    "## Getting Errors?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you might get a missing package error while building the catkin workspace. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Could not find a package configuration file provided by controller_manager\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This error refers to a ROS package from ROS Control. You can fix it by installing the associated Linux package, which will contain and install the necessary ROS package. If unsure about the package name, a Google search can often help identify the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing the Package\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, this package is already installed in the workspace, so you shouldn’t receive the error. However, if needed, you can re-install the package with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-controller-manager\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using the VM image instead of the Udacity Workspace, replace `noetic` with `kinetic`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-controller-manager"
