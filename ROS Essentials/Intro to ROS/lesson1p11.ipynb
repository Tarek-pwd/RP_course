    "\n",
    "Before you can run any ROS nodes, you must start the Master process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Master process is responsible for the following (and more):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Providing naming and registration services to other running nodes\n",
    "- Tracking all publishers and subscribers\n",
    "- Aggregating log messages generated by the nodes\n",
    "- Facilitating connections between nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the master process, execute the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "roscore\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If all goes well (and it should), you will see output similar to this:\n",

    "![img](lesson1p10_img1.png)\n",

    "This indicates that ROS Master is running! To terminate the ROS Master process, you can simply send the SIGINT signal to the process by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the `roscore` terminal window.\n",

    "# Running Turtlesim Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the ROS Master is running, we can run our first two ROS nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, we will execute the `rosrun` command in a new terminal window, passing as parameters the name of the package we wish to run, and the name of the actual node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can open a second instance of your current terminal using `Ctrl+Shift+T`.\n",
    "- **Tab completion** is your friend. Each ROS distribution comes with a staggering number of packages, and an even more staggering number of nodes. In the bash shell, a single-tap of the tab key will autocomplete the command if there is a single match. A double-tap of the tab key will result in a list of all possible matches if a single match cannot be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will start the `turtlesim_node` in the `turtlesim` package using the following command in a second terminal instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will start the `turtle_teleop_key` node, also from the `turtlesim` package, in a third terminal instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the arrow keys with the `turtle_teleop_key` node’s console selected, we are able to move the turtle in turtlesim!\n",
