    "# Turtlesim Comms: List All Active Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will investigate Turtlesim communication commands and will cover the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Listing all active nodes\n",
    "- Listing all topics\n",
    "- Getting information about topics\n",
    "- Showing message information\n",
    "- Echoing messages in real-time\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve launched `turtlesim_node` and played around with sending commands via the `turtle_teleop_key` node, let’s dig deeper, to see what’s actually happening underneath the surface...\n",

    "## Listing All Active Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a list of all nodes that are active and have been registered with the ROS Master, we can use the command `rosnode list`. Let’s do so now:\n",

    "\n",
    "We can see that there are three active nodes that have been registered with the ROS Master:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **/rosout**:\n",
    "   - This node is launched by `roscore`.\n",
    "   - It subscribes to the standard `/rosout` topic, the topic to which all nodes send log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **/teleop_turtle**:\n",
    "   - This is our keyboard teleop node.\n",
    "   - Notice that it’s not named `turtle_teleop_key`. There’s no requirement that a node’s broadcasted name is the same as the name of its associated executable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **/turtlesim**:\n",
    "   - The node name associated with the `turtlesim_node`.\n"
