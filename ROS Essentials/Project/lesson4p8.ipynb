    "## Adding Gazebo Plugins for Sensors and Actuators\n",
    "\n",
    "You added sensors to your robot, allowing it to visualize the world around it! But how exactly does the camera sensor take those images in simulation? How does a lidar sensor take laser measurements in simulation? How exactly does your robot move in a simulated environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "URDF in itself can't help with that. However, Gazebo allows for plugins that implement specific use cases.\n",

    "### Sensor and Actuator Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the use of three such plugins:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A plugin for the camera sensor.\n",
    "2. A plugin for the Hokuyo lidar sensor.\n",
    "3. A plugin for the wheel joints actuator.\n",

    "#### Gazebo Plugin Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have a two-wheeled mobile robot, we will use a plugin that implements a differential drive controller. Let's take a look at how the plugin is defined in the `my_robot.gazebo` file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<gazebo>\n",
    "  <plugin name=\"differential_drive_controller\" filename=\"libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so\">\n",

    "\n",
    "`libgazebo_ros_diff_drive.so` is the shared object file created from compiling the C++ source code. The plugin accepts information specific to your robot's model, such as wheel separation, joint names, and more. Then it calculates and publishes the robot's odometry information to the topics that you specified, like `odom`. In an upcoming section, you will send velocity commands to your robot to move it in a specific direction. This controller helps achieve that result.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to understand how this plugin was created, you can refer to its [C++ source code](http://wiki.ros.org/gazebo_plugins).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gazebo already has several such plugins publicly available. We will utilize the preexisting [camera sensor plugin](http://gazebosim.org/plugins?cat=sensor) and the preexisting [Hokuyo lidar sensor plugin](http://gazebosim.org/plugins?cat=sensor). Both of these are already included in the `my_robot.gazebo` file linked previously.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we proceed to test these sensors and actuators with ROS, you need to make sure that your plugins are imported by your URDF `my_robot.xacro` file as well. Import the sensors plugins by adding the following code to the top of the file (immediately before you define the `robot_footprint` link):\n",
