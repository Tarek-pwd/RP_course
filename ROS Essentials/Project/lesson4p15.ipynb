    "## Writing the process_image Client Node\n",
    "\n",
    "The second node that you’ll write in this project is the `process_image` node. This client node will subscribe to the robot’s camera images and analyze them to determine the position of the white ball. Once the ball position is determined, the client node will request a service from the `drive_bot` server node to drive the robot toward the ball. The robot can drive either left, right, or forward, depending on the ball’s position inside the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you write this node, place the white ball in front of the robot’s camera. If everything works, your node should analyze the image, detect the ball’s position, and then request a `ball_chaser/command_robot` service to drive the robot towards the ball!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "The `process_image.cpp` client node is similar to the `look_away.cpp` client node that you wrote earlier. Both nodes contain a ROS subscriber and client. Please review the `look_away.cpp` node before you start coding the `process_image.cpp` node.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing the Images\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the ball’s presence and position inside the image, you will use a simple approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Search for white pixels inside the array image. Since the ball is the only object in the world that is white, white pixels indicate the ball’s presence.\n",
    "2. Identify the ball’s position with respect to the camera: left, middle, or right side of the image.\n",
