    "## Understanding Unified Robot Description Format (URDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Build My World project, you used the Model Editor tool in Gazebo to model a robot with the Simulation Description Format, or SDF. Now that you are working with ROS, you have to model a robot with the Unified Robot Description Format, or URDF. Both of these formats use XML markup language. We can use a URDF file to define a robot model, its kinodynamic properties, visual elements, and even model sensors for the robot. URDF can only describe a robot with rigid links connected by joints in a chain or tree structure. It cannot describe a robot with flexible or parallel links.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Robot Description Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple robot with two links and a joint can be described using URDF as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n",
    "<robot name=\"two_link_robot\">\n",
    "  <!--Links-->\n",
    "  <link name=\"link_1\">\n",
    "    <visual>\n",
    "      <geometry>\n",
    "        <cylinder length=\"0.5\" radius=\"0.2\"/>\n",
    "      </geometry>\n",
    "    </visual>\n",
    "  </link>\n",
    "  <link name=\"link_2\">\n",
    "    <visual>\n",
    "      <geometry>\n",
    "        <box size=\"0.6 0.1 0.2\"/>\n",
    "      </geometry>\n",
    "    </visual>\n",
    "  </link>\n",
    "  <!--Joints-->\n",
    "  <joint name=\"joint_1\" type=\"continuous\">\n",
    "    <parent link=\"link_1\"/>\n",
    "    <child link=\"link_2\"/>\n",
    "  </joint>\n",
    "</robot>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we use URDF files to describe several robot and environmental properties, the files tend to be long and tedious. This is why we use **Xacro** (XML Macros) to divide our single URDF file into multiple Xacro files. While the syntax remains the same, we can now divide our robot description into smaller subsystems.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Important URDF Tags and Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `<robot>` Tag\n",
    "This is a top-level tag that contains all the other tags related to a given robot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `<link>` Tag\n",
    "Each rigid link in a robot must have this tag associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes:**\n",
    "  - `name`: Requires a unique link name attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elements:**\n",
    "  - `<visual>`: Specifies the appearance of the object for visualization purposes.\n",
    "    - `<origin>`: Reference frame of the visual element relative to the reference frame of the link.\n",
    "    - `<geometry>`: Shape of the visual object.\n",
    "    - `<material>`: Material of the visual element.\n",
    "  - `<collision>`: Specifies the collision properties of a link. These can be simpler than the visual properties to reduce computation time.\n",
    "    - `<origin>`: Reference frame of the collision element.\n",
    "    - `<geometry>`: Geometry of the collision element.\n",
    "  - `<inertial>`: Describes the inertial properties of the link.\n",
    "    - `<origin>`: Pose of the inertial reference frame relative to the link reference frame.\n",
    "    - `<mass>`: Mass of the link.\n",
    "    - `<inertia>`: Rotational inertia matrix (symmetric, so only 6 elements are specified).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example snippet for `<link>` tag:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<link name=\"link_1\">\n",

    "#### `<joint>` Tag\n",
    "Defines a single joint between two links in a robot. Types of joints include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fixed:** Rigid joint with no degrees of freedom.\n",
    "- **Revolute:** Range-limited joint that rotates about an axis.\n",
    "- **Prismatic:** Range-limited joint that slides along an axis.\n",
    "- **Continuous:** Similar to a Revolute joint but has no limits.\n",
    "- **Planar:** A 2D prismatic joint that allows motion in a plane perpendicular to an axis.\n",
    "- **Floating:** A joint with 6 degrees of freedom, used for quadrotors and UAVs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Attributes:**\n",
    "  - `name`: Unique joint name.\n",
    "  - `type`: Type of joint.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elements:**\n",
    "  - `<origin>`: Transform from the parent link to the child link. The joint is located at the origin of the child link.\n",
    "  - `<parent>`: Name of the parent link.\n",
    "  - `<child>`: Name of the child link.\n",
    "  - `<axis>`: Axis of rotation/translation (not applicable for fixed and floating joints).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example snippet for `<joint>` tag:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<joint name=\"joint_2\" type=\"revolute\">\n",
