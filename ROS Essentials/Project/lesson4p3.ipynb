    "The first task in this project is to create the `my_robot` ROS package. Inside `my_robot`, you will store and launch an empty Gazebo world file. As you proceed with the project, you will model and store a robot, as well as replace the empty world file with the world you created in the Build My World project. For now, follow these steps to set up `my_robot`.\n",
