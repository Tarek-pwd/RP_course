    "### Visualizing the Robot in RViz\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will display your model in RViz and visualize data from the camera and lidar sensors. You will also actuate your robot and drive it around!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modify `robot_description`\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by modifying the `robot_description.launch` file. Open it and add these lines after the first `param` definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<!-- Send fake joint values-->\n",
    "<node name=\"joint_state_publisher\" pkg=\"joint_state_publisher\" type=\"joint_state_publisher\">\n",
    "  <param name=\"use_gui\" value=\"false\"/>\n",
    "</node>\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- Send robot states to tf -->\n",
    "<node name=\"robot_state_publisher\" pkg=\"robot_state_publisher\" type=\"robot_state_publisher\" respawn=\"false\" output=\"screen\"/>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These elements add two nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`joint_state_publisher`:** Publishes joint state messages for the robot, such as the angles for the non-fixed joints.\n",
    "2. **`robot_state_publisher`:** Publishes the robot's state to `tf` (transform tree). Your robot model has several frames corresponding to each link/joint. The `robot_state_publisher` publishes the 3D poses of all these links, offering a convenient and efficient advantage, especially for more complicated robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modify `world.launch`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you need to launch RViz along with Gazebo. Open the `world.launch` file and add these elements after the `urdf_spawner` node definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<!-- Launch RViz -->\n",
    "<node name=\"rviz\" pkg=\"rviz\" type=\"rviz\" respawn=\"false\"/>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a node that launches the `rviz` package. Let's launch it ðŸš€\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Launch!\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd ~/catkin_ws/\n",
    "$ source devel/setup.bash\n",
    "$ roslaunch my_robot world.launch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This time, both Gazebo and RViz should launch!\n",

    "### RViz Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Set up RViz to visualize the sensor readings. On the left side of RViz, under Displays:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select `odom` for the fixed frame.\n",
    "2. Click the **Add** button and:\n",
    "   - Add `RobotModel` and your robot model should load up in RViz.\n",
    "   - Add `Camera` and select the Image topic that was defined in the camera Gazebo plugin.\n",
    "   - Add `LaserScan` and select the topic that was defined in the Hokuyo Gazebo plugin.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In Gazebo, add a box, sphere, or cylinder object in front of your robot. Your robotâ€™s sensors should be able to visualize it. You can check the Camera viewer on the bottom left side of RViz to see a picture of the new object. Also, you can see a red Laser scan inside the scene, reflecting from your object.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Image goes here*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drive Around\n",
    "\n",
    "While everything above is still running, test the robotâ€™s actuators and drive it around. Open a new terminal window and publish velocity commands to the robotâ€™s wheel actuators:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ cd ~/catkin_ws/\n",
    "$ source devel/setup.bash\n",
    "$ rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist  \"linear:\n",
    "      x: 0.1\n",
    "      y: 0.0\n",
    "      z: 0.0\n",
    "angular:\n",
    "      x: 0.0\n",
    "      y: 0.0\n",
    "      z: 0.1\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Do not type the entire `rostopic pub` command. Type up to `rostopic pub /cmd_vel`, then press the `TAB` key twice to autocomplete the message. This ensures that you are publishing the command in the correct format. Once the complete message appears, modify the values to set the desired velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command publishes messages to the `cmd_vel` topic defined in the drive controller plugin. The values set for `linear.x` and `angular.z` will enable the robot to start moving in a circle.\n"
