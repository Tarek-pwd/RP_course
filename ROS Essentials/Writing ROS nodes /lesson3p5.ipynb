    "Below is the complete code for the `simple_mover` C++ node, with line-by-line comments embedded. You can copy and paste this code into the `simple_mover` script you created in `~/catkin_ws/src/simple_arm/src/` directory as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a new terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   $ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/simple_arm/src/\n",
    "   $ gedit simple_mover.cpp\n",

    "2. Open the `simple_mover.cpp` file with the `gedit` editor, copy and paste the code below into the script, and save the file. Itâ€™s encouraged to write this code yourself instead of copying it to get more familiar with the syntax.\n",

    "**VIDEO GOES HERE **\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `#include \"ros/ros.h\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ros` header is the official client library for ROS. It provides fundamental functionality required for interfacing with ROS via C++, such as tools for creating nodes and interacting with topics, services, and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `#include \"std_msgs/Float64.h\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Float64` header from the `std_msgs` package is imported. This package contains primitive message types in ROS. In this code, `Float64` messages are published to the position command topics for each joint.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `ros::init(argc, argv, \"arm_mover\");`\n",
    "\n",
    "A ROS node is initialized with the `init()` function and registered with the ROS Master. Here, `arm_mover` is the name of the node. The `argc` and `argv` arguments are passed to the `init()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. `ros::NodeHandle n;`\n",
    "\n",
    "A node handle object `n` is created from the `NodeHandle` class. This object initializes the node and permits communication with the ROS Master.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. `ros::Publisher` Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "ros::Publisher joint1_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::Float64>(\"/simple_arm/joint_1_position_controller/command\", 10);\n",
    "ros::Publisher joint2_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::Float64>(\"/simple_arm/joint_2_position_controller/command\", 10);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These lines create two publishers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One for joint 1 commands.\n",
    "- One for joint 2 commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `advertise` function registers the publishers with the ROS Master and specifies the message type (`Float64`) and queue size (10).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. `ros::Rate loop_rate(10);`\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop rate is set to 10Hz, which determines how often the loop cycles. Setting an appropriate rate prevents unnecessary CPU usage or high latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. ROS Time Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- `start_time = ros::Time::now().toSec();`: Initializes `start_time` to the current time.\n",
    "- `elapsed = ros::Time::now().toSec() - start_time;`: Calculates elapsed time in the main loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Joint Angles\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "std_msgs::Float64 joint1_angle, joint2_angle;\n",
    "joint1_angle.data = sin(2 * M_PI * 0.1 * elapsed) * (M_PI / 2);\n",
    "joint2_angle.data = sin(2 * M_PI * 0.1 * elapsed) * (M_PI / 2);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The joint angles are sampled from a sine wave with a 10-second period, oscillating between `-pi/2` and `pi/2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Publishing Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "joint1_pub.publish(joint1_angle);\n",
    "joint2_pub.publish(joint2_angle);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration of the loop publishes joint command messages for both joints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Loop Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The `loop_rate.sleep()` function ensures the loop runs at approximately 10Hz. When the node receives a shutdown signal, the loop exits."
