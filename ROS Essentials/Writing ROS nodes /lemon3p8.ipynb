    "You’ve written your first ROS C++ node! This was no trivial task. You’ve had to learn quite a few things to get to this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we rush off, we have more ground to cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom message generation\n",
    "- Services\n",
    "- Parameters\n",
    "- Launch Files\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gain an understanding of the above, you will write another node called **arm_mover**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of Arm Mover\n",
    "\n",
    "In many respects, `arm_mover` is quite similar to `simple_mover`. Like `simple_mover`, it is responsible for commanding the arm to move. However, instead of simply commanding the arm to follow a predetermined trajectory, the `arm_mover` node provides the service `safe_move`, which allows other nodes in the system to send `movement_commands`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to allowing movements via a service interface, `arm_mover` also allows for configurable minimum and maximum joint angles, by using parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a New Service Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "An interaction with a service consists of two messages. A node passes a **request** message to the service, and the service returns a **response** message to the node. The definitions of the request and response message types are contained within `.srv` files living in the `srv` directory under the package’s root.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Define the Service\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the `simple_arm` package directory:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd ~/catkin_ws/src/simple_arm/\n",
    "   mkdir srv\n",
    "   cd srv\n",
    "   gedit GoToPosition.srv\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Edit `GoToPosition.srv` to include:\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   float64 joint_1\n",
    "   float64 joint_2\n",
    "   ---\n",
    "   string msg_feedback\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Service definitions always contain two sections, separated by a `---` line:\n",
    "- **Request message**: Two `float64` fields, one for each of `simple_arm`’s joints.\n",
    "- **Response message**: A single `string` field (`msg_feedback`) indicating the arm has moved to a new position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Custom Message Types\n",
    "Defining a custom message type is very similar. The only differences are:\n",
    "- Message definitions live in the `msg` directory of the package root.\n",
    "- They have a `.msg` extension.\n",
    "- They do not contain the `---` section divider.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, see the [ROS Wiki on creating messages](http://wiki.ros.org/msg) and [services](http://wiki.ros.org/srv).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modifying `CMakeLists.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the necessary C++ libraries for messages in your code, modify `simple_arm`’s `CMakeLists.txt`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uncomment the `add_service_files()` macro:\n",
    "   ```cmake\n",
    "   add_service_files(\n",
    "      FILES\n",
    "      GoToPosition.srv\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ensure the `generate_messages()` macro is uncommented:\n",
    "   ```cmake\n",
    "   generate_messages(\n",
    "      DEPENDENCIES\n",
    "      std_msgs  # Or other packages containing msgs\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Force ROS to compile your C++ code with C++ 11:\n",
    "   ```cmake\n",
    "   add_compile_options(-std=c++11)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modifying `package.xml`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `package.xml` file defines the package’s properties and dependencies. Add the following dependencies if not already present:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>\n",
    "<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>\n",
    "\n",
    "<run_depend>controller_manager</run_depend>\n",
    "<run_depend>effort_controllers</run_depend>\n",
    "<run_depend>gazebo_plugins</run_depend>\n",
    "<run_depend>gazebo_ros</run_depend>\n",
    "<run_depend>gazebo_ros_control</run_depend>\n",
    "<run_depend>joint_state_controller</run_depend>\n",
    "<run_depend>joint_state_publisher</run_depend>\n",
    "<run_depend>robot_state_publisher</run_depend>\n",
    "<run_depend>message_runtime</run_depend>\n",
    "<run_depend>xacro</run_depend>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, check the [ROS Wiki on package.xml](http://wiki.ros.org/package.xml).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking the Service with ROS\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you’ve created your `GoToPosition` service file, ensure ROS recognizes it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Source your workspace:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   cd ~/catkin_ws/\n",
    "   source devel/setup.bash\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the `rossrv show` command:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   rossrv show GoToPosition\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see:\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "[simple_arm/GoToPosition]:\n",
    "float64 joint_1\n",
    "float64 joint_2\n",
    "---\n",
    "string msg_feedback\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job! You accomplished so much in this lesson:\n",
    "1. Created the `GoToPosition.srv` file.\n",
    "2. Added its dependencies in `CMakeLists.txt`.\n",
    "3. Verified build and run dependencies in `package.xml`.\n",
    "4. Checked if ROS recognizes your service file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s move on to coding!\n"
