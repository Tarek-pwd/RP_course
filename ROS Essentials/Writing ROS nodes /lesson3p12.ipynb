    "## Description of Look Away\n",
    "\n",
    "To see a ROS subscriber and client in action, you'll write a node called `look_away`. The `look_away` node will subscribe to the `/rgb_camera/image_raw` topic, which has image data from the camera mounted on the end of the robotic arm. Whenever the camera is pointed towards an uninteresting image - in this case, an image with uniform color - the callback function will request a `safe_move` service to safely move the arm to something more interesting. There are a few extra pieces in the code to ensure that this procedure is executed smoothly, but weâ€™ll focus on those later.\n",

    "### Updating the Launch File\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as you did with the `arm_mover` node, to get `look_away` to launch with the rest of the nodes, you will need to modify `robot_spawn.launch`, which can be found in `~/catkin_ws/src/simple_arm/launch`. You can add the following code there:\n",

    "\n",
    "Remember that a half turn of a joint requires `pi/2` radians of revolution. Numerically, `pi/2` is approximately `1.57`. Since we want to be able to revolve a joint halfway around with one request, it will be helpful to set `max_joint_2_angle: 1.57` in `arm_mover`:\n",
