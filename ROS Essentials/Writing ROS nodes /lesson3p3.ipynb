    "# Understanding ROS Publishers in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you see the code for `simple_mover`, it may be helpful to see how ROS Publishers work in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Publishers allow a node to send messages to a topic so that data from the node can be used in other parts of ROS. In C++, ROS publishers typically have the following definition format, although other parameters and arguments are possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "ros::Publisher pub1 = n.advertise<message_type>(\"/topic_name\", queue_size);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Publisher Object**:\n",
    "   - `pub1` is a publisher object instantiated from the `ros::Publisher` class.\n",
    "   - This object allows you to publish messages by calling the `publish()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **NodeHandle**:\n",
    "   - To communicate with ROS master in C++, you need a `NodeHandle`.\n",
    "   - The node handle `n` will fully initialize the node.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **advertise() Function**:\n",
    "   - The `advertise()` function is used to inform ROS that you want to publish a message on a given topic name.\n",
    "   - `\"/topic_name\"` indicates which topic the publisher will be publishing to.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Message Type**:\n",
    "   - `message_type` is the type of message being published on `\"/topic_name\"`.\n",
    "   - Example: The string message data type in ROS is `std_msgs::String`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Queue Size**:\n",
    "   - `queue_size` indicates the number of messages that can be stored in a queue.\n",
    "   - A publisher can store messages in a queue until the messages can be sent.\n",
    "   - If the number of messages stored exceeds the size of the queue, the oldest messages are dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Publishing a Message\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the publisher object `pub1` has been created, a message with the specified data type can be published as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "pub1.publish(msg);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information about C++ ROS publishers, see the [documentation here](https://wiki.ros.org/roscpp).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quiz Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that a queued message is typically picked up in an average time of 1/10th of a second with a standard deviation of 1/20th of a second, and your publisher is publishing at a frequency of 10Hz. Of the options below, which would be the best setting for `queue_size`?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
