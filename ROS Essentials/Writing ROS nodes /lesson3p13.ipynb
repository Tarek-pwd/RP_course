The `queue_size` is set to 10, meaning that a maximum of 10 messages can be stored in the queue. The data from each new incoming message is passed to the `joint_states_callback` function.\n",
    "- The second subscriber object `sub2` subscribes to the `/rgb_camera/image_raw` topic. The `queue_size` is also set to 10. And the `look_away_callback` function is called each time a new message arrives.\n",
