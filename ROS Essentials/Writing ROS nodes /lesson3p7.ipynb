    "# Introduction to ROS Services\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've written your first ROS node, you've seen how publishing to a topic works, and you were able to control the robotic arm by publishing to the `/simple_arm/joint_1_position_controller/command` topic and `/simple_arm/joint_2_position_controller/command` topic. Next, we'll explore another node called `arm_mover`, which implements the `safe_move` service to allow service calls to control the arm.\n",

    "## Defining Services\n",
    "\n",
    "A ROS service allows request/response communication to exist between nodes. Within the node providing the service, request messages are handled by functions or methods. Once the requests have been handled successfully, the node providing the service sends a message back to the requester node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Service Server Definition Format\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, a ROS service server can be created using the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "ros::ServiceServer service = n.advertiseService(\"service_name\", handler);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`ServiceServer`**: The class name that comes from the file where the service definition exists.\n",
    "- **`.srv File`**: A text file that defines the request and response message types.\n",
    "- **`advertiseService()`**: Allows the node handle `n` to inform ROS that you want to create a service.\n",
    "- **`service_name`**: The name given to the service, used by other nodes to specify the service they are calling.\n",
    "- **`handler`**: The function or method that processes incoming service messages. The handler:\n",
    "  - Is called each time the service is requested.\n",
    "  - Takes the service call message as an argument.\n",
    "  - Returns an appropriate service response message.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Services\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Command Line**\n",
    "\n",
    "Services can be called directly from the command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ rosservice call service_name \"request\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After calling the service, you will wait for a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **ROS Service Client**\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to use a ROS service programmatically within a node. You define a ROS client, which provides the interface for sending messages to the service:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "ros::ServiceClient client = n.serviceClient<package_name::service_file_name>(\"service_name\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To send requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "client.call(srv); // Request a service\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we’ll focus on how to create the ROS service server. Later, in the `look_away` node, you will practice calling the service from a service client node.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [ROS documentation on services](https://wiki.ros.org/Services) for detailed instructions on how to create and call ROS services.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quiz Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which of the following ROS nodes might best be implemented using a service?**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started with the `arm_mover` code, where you’ll see how to combine the `safe_move` service with publishers in a node. This ensures that whenever a service is requested, it will also publish messages to a topic."
