    "# Implementing Your First ROS Node in C++: simple_mover\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now go through the process of implementing your first ROS node in C++. This node is called `simple_mover`. As its name implies, this node only has one responsibility: to command joint movements for `simple_arm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the `simple_mover` node is to command each joint in the simple arm and make it swing between `-pi/2` to `pi/2` over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hereâ€™s a demonstration of this node in action:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**video goes here**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, the node must publish joint angle command messages to the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Topic Name                                             | Message Type      | Description                                      |\n",

    "## Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you no longer have the `catkin_ws` or `simple_arm` package from the previous lesson, you need to re-create a new `catkin_ws` and clone the package inside your `~/catkin_ws/src` directory with:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src/\n",

    "\n",
    "## Adding the Source Directory\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create a new node in C++, you must first create the `src` directory within the `simple_arm` package, as it does not yet exist:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Creating a New Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the source directory has been created, C++ scripts can be added to the package. Now, create the `simple_mover` C++ script inside the source directory of the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
