    "# Components of a Gazebo Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six components involved in running an instance of a Gazebo simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gazebo Server**\n",
    "2. **Gazebo Client**\n",
    "3. **World Files**\n",
    "4. **Model Files**\n",
    "5. **Environment Variables**\n",
    "6. **Plugins**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Gazebo Server\n",
    "\n",
    "The first main component involved in running an instance of a Gazebo simulation is the **Gazebo Server**, also known as `gzserver`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gzserver` performs most of the heavy lifting for Gazebo.\n",
    "- It is responsible for parsing the description files related to the scene being simulated and the objects within it.\n",
    "- It then simulates the complete scene using a physics and sensor engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can launch the server independently using the following command in a terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ gzserver\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: `gzserver` does not include a GUI component. Running it in headless mode can be useful in certain scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Gazebo Client\n",
    "\n",
    "The second main component is the **Gazebo Client**, also known as `gzclient`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gzclient` provides the essential Graphical Client that connects to `gzserver` and renders the simulation scene along with interactive tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can technically run `gzclient` by itself using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ gzclient\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it will not perform any useful function without a `gzserver` to connect to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Gazebo Server and Gazebo Client\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common practice to run `gzserver` first, followed by `gzclient`, allowing some time to initialize the simulation scene and parameters before rendering. Alternatively, you can use a single command to launch both components sequentially:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ gazebo\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. World Files\n",
    "\n",
    "A **world file** in Gazebo contains all the elements in the simulated environment, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your robot model\n",
    "- Environment\n",
    "- Lighting\n",
    "- Sensors\n",
    "- Other objects\n",
    "\n",
    "World files typically have a `.world` extension. You can save your simulation to a world file or load an existing one. To launch a simulation from a world file, use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "$ gazebo <yourworld>.world\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "World files are formatted using the **Simulation Description Format (SDF)**. Below is an example of a basic SDF world file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<?xml version=\"1.0\" ?>\n",
    "<sdf version=\"1.5\">\n",
    "  <world name=\"default\">\n",
    "    <physics type=\"ode\">\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "    </physics>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <scene>\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "    </scene>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <model name=\"box\">\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "    </model>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <model name=\"sphere\">\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "    </model>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <light name=\"spotlight\">\n",
    "      ...\n",
    "    </light>\n",
    "  </world>\n",
    "</sdf>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Model Files\n",
    "\n",
    "A **model file** is a separate SDF file that represents a single model, such as a robot. Keeping models in separate files makes them reusable across projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To include a model file in a world file, use the following syntax in the worldâ€™s SDF file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<include>\n",
    "  <uri>model://model_file_name</uri>\n",
    "</include>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Environment Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Gazebo uses several **environment variables** to locate files (world, model, etc.) and set up communication between `gzserver` and `gzclient`. These variables are typically left as default.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "`GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH`: A list of directories where Gazebo searches for model files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plugins** allow interaction with a world, model, or sensor in Gazebo. They can be loaded from the command line or added to the SDF world file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: World plugins will be covered in later lessons.\n"
