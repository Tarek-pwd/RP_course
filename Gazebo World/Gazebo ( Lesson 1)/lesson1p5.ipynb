    "# Gazebo GUI Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gazebo GUI is divided into four major sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scene**\n",
    "2. **Side Panel**\n",
    "3. **Toolbars**\n",
    "4. **Menu**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scene\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Scene** is where you will spend most of your time, whether creating a simulation or running one. While you can use a trackpad to navigate inside the scene, a mouse is highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Panning**: Press the left mouse button and drag.\n",
    "- **Rotating**: Hold down `SHIFT` while dragging the left mouse button.\n",
    "- **Zooming**: Use the mouse scroll or press and drag the right mouse button (RMB).\n",
    "\n",
    "![mouse image](lp5_img_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Side Panel\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Side Panel** on the left consists of three tabs:\n",
    "\n",
    "### World\n",
    "\n",
    "- Displays the lights and models currently in the scene.\n",
    "- Allows viewing and editing of basic model parameters like position and orientation.\n",
    "- Provides access to physics options, such as gravity and magnetic field, via the **Physics** option.\n",
    "- The **GUI** option gives access to the default camera view angle and pose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Insert\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contains objects (models) to add to the simulation scene.\n",
    "- Left-click to expand or collapse a list of models.\n",
    "- To place an object:\n",
    "  1. Left-click the object under the Insert tab.\n",
    "  2. Bind the object to your mouse cursor.\n",
    "  3. Place it in the scene by left-clicking at the desired location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "- An optional feature; this tab is usually empty.\n",
    "- *(Learn more about Layers by clicking here.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Top Toolbar\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Top Toolbar** provides quick access to cursor types, geometric shapes, and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cursor Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select Mode**: The default cursor mode for navigating the scene.\n",
    "2. **Translate Mode**: Adjust an object's position directly in the scene using axis-based dragging.\n",
    "3. **Rotate Mode**: Change the orientation of an object.\n",
    "4. **Scale Mode**: Modify the scale (size) of any model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Undo/Redo**: Revert or redo actions.\n",
    "- **Simple Shapes**: Add basic 3D models like cubes, spheres, or cylinders.\n",
    "- **Lights**: Insert light sources, such as spotlight, point light, or directional light.\n",
    "- **Copy/Paste**: Duplicate models using these tools or `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V`.\n",
    "- **Align**: Align models along one of the three principal axes.\n",
    "- **Change View**: Switch between perspectives like top, side, front, or bottom views.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bottom Toolbar\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Bottom Toolbar** includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Play/Pause Button**: Pause the simulation and move objects around.\n",
    "- **Simulation Data**: Displays simulation time, real time, and their ratio.\n",
    "- **Frames-per-Second Counter**: Monitors system performance for the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Menu\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Menu** duplicates some toolbar options and right-click context menu options in the scene. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Edit**: Switch to the Building Editor to design buildings or the Model Editor to create models.\n",
    "- *(We will explore these features in upcoming lessons.)*\n",
