    "1. **Udacity Office**:\n",
    "   - A building model created using the **Building Editor** tool in Gazebo.\n",
    "   - Includes detailed features and colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Green Humanoid Robot**:\n",
    "   - Two instances of a model designed using the **Model Editor** tool in Gazebo.\n",

    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Your project should:\n",
    "1. Include the same aspects as the sample project.\n",
    "2. Follow the directory structure outlined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a Location**:\n",
    "   - Select a place to deploy your robot, such as:\n",
    "     - Your apartment\n",
    "     - Your office\n",
    "     - Your favorite restaurant\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Custom Model**:\n",
    "   - Design any model of your choice using the **Model Editor** tool in Gazebo.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Import a Model**:\n",
    "   - Select and import a model from the Gazebo online library.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Design a Building**:\n",
    "   - Use the **Building Editor** tool to create a structure representing your chosen location.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Add a Welcome Plugin**:\n",
    "   - Write a world plugin (e.g., `welcome_message.cpp`) to print a custom message in the terminal when the simulation runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these instructions, you can build a unique simulation environment in Gazebo tailored to your chosen location.\n"
